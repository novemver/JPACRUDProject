## Lessons Learned

I praticed mapping entities and performing CRUD operations utilizing a Data Base I created with MySQL Workbench. I am learning how to make sure my mapping is correct by performing a JUnit tests.  One challenge for me in this project were making sure my data types and fields matched my Entity class and members. Another friction point was keeping my jsp files organized and talking to each other. It was easy to make a typo or other error while creating the jsp files to display and recieve data. I learned to commit my progress after making any significant change as way to track progress or revert back to. I learned to slow down and take time to read error messages which helped me find my errors.
